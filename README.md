Inventory Management System

The Inventory Management System is a desktop application developed in Python (Tkinter) with SQLite as the backend database.
It is designed to help small businesses manage and monitor their inventory, suppliers, and sales through an easy-to-use graphical interface.

How it Works

The system stores all product, supplier, and sales data in a local SQLite database.

A Tkinter-based user interface provides forms and tables for managing data.

Sales and inventory records are analyzed and displayed using charts generated with Matplotlib.

Stock levels are monitored in real-time, and the system provides alerts when items fall below the defined reorder level.
